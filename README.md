# 2020 NFL Injuries
An analysis of how injuries during the 2020 NFL season compare to the previous 5 seasons.

## Motivation

Sports in 2020 have been interesting to say the least. The NFL decided to forego pre-season games this year and I was interested how that impacted injuries. Pre-season gives the players a chance to ramp up to a game-speed like atmosphere before the regualr season starts. I was curious if there would be more injuries in the absence of the preseason. 

### Data Questions

  1. How do injuries in the 2020 season compare to the previous 5 seasons?
  2. Were there more injuries in the first 4 weeks of the season compared to previous seasons due to the absence of a preseason?
  3. Are some positions more prone to injuries than others?

2. Compared to the past 5 seasons, injuries were down over the first 4 weeks of the season.
3. Offensive Lineman, Cornerbacks and Linebackers are the most prone to missing games due to injury.
